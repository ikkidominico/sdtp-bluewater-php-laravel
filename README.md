# Bluewater

Bluewater project, developed with PHP and Laravel as admission exam at SDTP Foundation.

## Installation

First of all, Bluewater requires these following dependencies:
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

And you can install them following these tutorials from Docker documentations:
- [Docker Install](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose Install](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

After install and configure the dependencies, check that you are in your home directory, clone the Bluewater repository and move into it:

```sh
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/ikkidominico/sdtp-bluewater-php-laravel.git
cd ~/sdtp-bluewater-php-laravel
```

Next, use Dockerâ€™s composer image to mount the directories that you will need for your Bluewater project, avoiding the overhead of installing Composer globally and set some permissions on the project directory:

```sh
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app composer install
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER ~/sdtp-bluewater-php-laravel
```

With your application code in place, now you can move on to configure the Bluewater application.

## Configuration

### Environment

Initially, create the .env file copying from the .env.example:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Inside .env file, change these following properties to correctly connect with database:

```sh
DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
DB_HOST=database
DB_PORT=5432
DB_DATABASE=bluewater
DB_USERNAME=bluewater
DB_PASSWORD=bluewater
```

### Boot

To start the Bluewater application, run the Docker Compose with the following command: 

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

The following command will generate a key and copy it to your .env file:

```sh
docker-compose exec app php artisan key:generate
```

You now have the environment settings required to run your application. To cache these settings into a file, run:

```sh
docker-compose exec app php artisan config:cache
```

### Migration and Seed

First, test the connection with database running the Laravel artisan migrate command, which creates a migrations table in the database from inside the container:

```sh
docker-compose exec app php artisan migrate
```

Once the migration is complete, you can run a command to seed the database with fake informations:

```sh
docker-compose exec app php artisan db:seed
```

After, you can run a query to check if you are properly connected to the database using the tinker command:

```sh
docker-compose exec app php artisan tinker
```

And getting the data that you just migrated:

```sh
>>> \DB::table('migrations')->get();
```
